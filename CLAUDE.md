# PATH-CI-PrintingWorkflows

Project PATH app. Remote: `RMIT-VE-LearningExperience/PATH_CI_PrintingWorkflow`.

## Git workflow
- GitHub account: always `RMIT-VE-LearningExperience`, never the personal `arielle-lee-github` account. Pushes as the personal account fail with a 403.
- Default branch for pushes and merges: `Staging-PrintingWorkflows`. Never push or merge to `main` unless explicitly told to promote.
- If it is unclear which branch a push or merge should target, ask first.
- Confirm before any push.

## Content imports (Canvas → this app)
- Import one entry at a time, never in bulk.
- For each entry: inspect the Canvas page (read-only), propose the mapping (Course/Product naming, scope, Step granularity), get explicit sign-off, then import, then verify via `/api/tutorial`.
- Don't enumerate a Canvas account to find a resource. Ask for the direct link.
